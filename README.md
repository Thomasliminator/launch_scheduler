# Launch Scheduler
### Written by Thomas Lim
#### NASA Summer Internship Programming Challenge

### Assumptions
1. The months of March and May do not have any launches scheduled. (e.g. a Moose-type launch can be scheduled on April 1 or April 30 with no issues)
2. All 10 launches on the original launch schedule must appear in the April launch schedule.
3. Because the delay cost is per vehicle type, there is no cost to switch launches of the same type. (e.g. if a batch of Bumblebee launches are delayed by 1 day, the total delay cost is 0.5 dollars, not 2 dollars.)
